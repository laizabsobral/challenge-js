# Responsive Layout with React + Vite + TailwindCSS

This project is a **responsive layout demo** built with **React, Vite, and TailwindCSS**.  
It showcases a simple but flexible page structure with a `Header`, `Main area` (Hero, Sidebar, Main Content, Extra Content), and `Footer`.  
The layout is fully responsive and uses `flexbox` utilities from TailwindCSS.
